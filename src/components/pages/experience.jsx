                            Starting in May of 2023, I had my very first co-op work term with a company called Deleptual. 
                            Being apart of a small team at Deleptual as a Junior Programmer gave me the opportunity to learn 
                            in-depth about the process of completing a software project from start to finish. 
                            My role on the small team at Deleptual allowed me to really hone my skills for independent learning 
                            and front-end development. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                            In this report, I will further detail my experience at Deleptual, including employer information, my position,
                             and finally reflect on my learning goals for the term.
