        project: "May Nguyen's Website",
        date: "November 1st, 2023",
        description: "The first edition of my website was all different shades of pink, which was a bit offensive to the eyes. I’m a nostalgic person, so remnants of that original design can still be found in my website favicon. Pink is one of my favourite colours - second only to light blue - but it’s a bit controversial in terms of its gendering (maybe less so now with the debut of the Barbie movie). I decided to change my website theme to mostly neutral colours so that it’d be welcoming to all, including those with an aversion to pink. The new theme I decided on also better suits majority of photos I decided to use on my website, most of which are ultimate frisbee photos taken on lush, green fields. Green and brown go well together, and I think nature would agree. During the time of writing this, my website’s About page is blank. While I’ve updated my website to have a more palatable theme, included important links and featured more photos of myself and my life, the content for the About Me section of things is where I struggle the most. I want my website to reflect everything May Nguyen - a digital diary of everything I’ve learned whether that’s ultimate frisbee, books I’ve read, music I like or places I’ve travelled. I have big aspirations of what my About section will be. Which is why it’s blank right now. I’ll return to this when I don’t have assignments to finish. "
